### What did you do particularly well?

I believe that I did pretty well when reviewing the requirements and provided my best insight into what to use and why use it. Understanding how somehitng could be beneficial for the client.

### If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I have always believe that their is always room for improvement. However, I'm certain that this project only covered the surface. I could have go more in depth about all the use cases and improve the diagrams to reflect the full scope of the project.

### How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I beleive a good system designer need to understand what the users/client needs. In order to provide high quality systems and service, the analyst must focus on meeting the user/client expectations. If we dont consider the user needs the nobody is going to use the application and we would not be doing our job properly.

### How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
After I gather all the information, I'd like to start creating the flow of how everything should work. The different types of diagram really helps draw that "straight" line that the developer can follow, and leave less room for assumptions. Most of the deadlines that are not meant, is most likely becuase the system design is lacking in some area.
